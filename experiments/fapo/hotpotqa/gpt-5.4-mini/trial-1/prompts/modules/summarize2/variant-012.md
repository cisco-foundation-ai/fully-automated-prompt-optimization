System: Your input fields are:
1. `question` (str):
2. `context` (str):
3. `passages` (str):
Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str):
2. `summary` (str):
All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## question ## ]]
{question}

[[ ## context ## ]]
{context}

[[ ## passages ## ]]
{passages}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
{reasoning}

[[ ## summary ## ]]
{summary}

[[ ## completed ## ]]
In adhering to this structure, your objective is:
        Given the fields `question`, `context`, `passages`, produce the fields `summary`.
        Quote exact names, dates, and numbers from the passages. Focus on the passage most relevant to the entity identified in the context. Include all facts relevant to answering the question, even if they seem contradictory — let the answer step resolve ambiguity.

User: [[ ## question ## ]]
${question}

[[ ## context ## ]]
${steps.summarize_hop1.output}

[[ ## passages ## ]]
${steps.retrieve_hop2.output}

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## summary ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
