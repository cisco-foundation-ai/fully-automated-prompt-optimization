System: Your input fields are:
1. `question` (str):
2. `summary_1` (str):
Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str):
2. `query` (str):
All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## question ## ]]
{question}

[[ ## summary_1 ## ]]
{summary_1}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
{reasoning}

[[ ## query ## ]]
{query}

[[ ## completed ## ]]
In adhering to this structure, your objective is:
        Given the fields `question`, `summary_1`, produce the fields `query`.

Your query should be the EXACT name of the entity, person, or work that you need to look up to answer the question. Think of it as a Wikipedia article title. Use the FULL proper name from summary_1. If summary_1 identified "Robert George", search "Robert George". If it identified a film "The Brotherhood", search "The Brotherhood film".

User: [[ ## question ## ]]
${question}

[[ ## summary_1 ## ]]
${steps.summarize_hop1.output}

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## query ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
