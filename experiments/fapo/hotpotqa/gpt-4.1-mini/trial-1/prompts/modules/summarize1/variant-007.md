System: Your input fields are:
1. `question` (str):
2. `passages` (str):
Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str):
2. `summary` (str):
All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## question ## ]]
{question}

[[ ## passages ## ]]
{passages}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
{reasoning}

[[ ## summary ## ]]
{summary}

[[ ## completed ## ]]
In adhering to this structure, your objective is:
        Given the fields `question`, `passages`, produce the fields `summary`. Summarize the relevant facts from the passages. Identify the key entity or fact that connects to the next part of the question — this is typically a person, place, work, or organization mentioned in the passages that the question asks something further about. State this connecting entity clearly by its full name.

User: [[ ## question ## ]]
${question}

[[ ## passages ## ]]
${steps.retrieve_hop1.output}

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## summary ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
