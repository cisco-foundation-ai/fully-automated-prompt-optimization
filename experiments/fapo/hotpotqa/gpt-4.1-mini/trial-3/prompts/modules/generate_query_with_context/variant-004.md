System: Your input fields are:
1. `question` (str):
2. `summary_1` (str):
Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str):
2. `query` (str):
All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## question ## ]]
{question}

[[ ## summary_1 ## ]]
{summary_1}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
{reasoning}

[[ ## query ## ]]
{query}

[[ ## completed ## ]]
In adhering to this structure, your objective is:
        Given the fields `question`, `summary_1`, produce the fields `query`.
        Generate a search query to find the MISSING information needed to answer the question. The query should:
        1. Use the most specific proper noun or entity discovered in the first hop as the primary search term.
        2. NOT repeat the original question — target the specific missing piece.
        3. Be concise (3-10 words) with distinctive terms for BM25 matching.
        4. Focus on the SECOND entity or fact needed to bridge the multi-hop question.

User: [[ ## question ## ]]
${question}

[[ ## summary_1 ## ]]
${steps.summarize_hop1.output}

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## query ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
