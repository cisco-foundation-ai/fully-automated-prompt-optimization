System: Your input fields are:
1. `question` (str):
2. `summary_1` (str):
Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str):
2. `query` (str):
All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## question ## ]]
{question}

[[ ## summary_1 ## ]]
{summary_1}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
{reasoning}

[[ ## query ## ]]
{query}

[[ ## completed ## ]]
In adhering to this structure, your objective is:
        Given the fields `question`, `summary_1`, produce the fields `query`.

Instructions: Generate a search query to find the information still needed to answer the question. Summary_1 provides the first hop's findings. Your query should target the specific entity, person, or topic that will provide the missing piece. Use the most distinctive proper noun or entity name from summary_1 that bridges to the answer. Keep the query short and specific.

User: [[ ## question ## ]]
${question}

[[ ## summary_1 ## ]]
${steps.summarize_hop1.output}

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## query ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
