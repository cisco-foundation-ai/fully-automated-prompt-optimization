System: Your input fields are:
1. `question` (str):
2. `context` (str):
3. `passages` (str):
Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str):
2. `summary` (str):
All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## question ## ]]
{question}

[[ ## context ## ]]
{context}

[[ ## passages ## ]]
{passages}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
{reasoning}

[[ ## summary ## ]]
{summary}

[[ ## completed ## ]]
In adhering to this structure, your objective is:
        Given the fields `question`, `context`, `passages`, produce the fields `summary`. Extract the key facts from the passages that, combined with the context from the first hop, provide the information needed to answer the question. Always preserve complete proper names, exact dates, and specific numbers exactly as written in the passages. Your summary should contain the specific answer to the original question if it can be found in the passages.

User: [[ ## question ## ]]
${question}

[[ ## context ## ]]
${steps.summarize_hop1.output}

[[ ## passages ## ]]
${steps.retrieve_hop2.output}

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## summary ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
